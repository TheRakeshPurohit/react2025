# React 2025

> [!WARNING]  
> The repository backing React 2025 has been updated to match what React actually will look like in 2025.
> 
> This means it uses all of the latest React 19 features, as well as improvements in Next.js in the past 4 years. You can still use this repo as an archived reference, but I would recommend checking out the new repo to see the latest patterns.
